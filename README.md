Spotify songs recommendation
This project uses machine learning techniques to build a system that recommends songs based on their musical features and popularity. It involves data preprocessing, feature selection, correlation analysis, and clustering to understand patterns and similarities in a large Spotify dataset. Songs are recommended by analyzing features like danceability, energy, loudness, tempo, and more. Tools like K-Means clustering, PCA, and correlation matrices help group similar tracks and suggest songs to users accordingly.
